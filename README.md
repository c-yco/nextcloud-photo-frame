# Nextcloud Photo Discovery App

A Dockerized application that displays random photos from a Nextcloud instance with weighted selection based on recency and "favorite" status.

## Architecture

- **App**: Flask web interface to display photos.
- **Worker**: Background process that scans Nextcloud via WebDAV, extracts EXIF data, and updates Redis.
- **Redis**: Stores photo metadata and weights.
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy for the application.

## Setup

1.  Create a `.env` file with your Nextcloud credentials:
    ```env
    NC_URL=https://your-nextcloud-instance.com/remote.php/dav/files/your-username
    NC_USER=your-username
    NC_PASS=your-app-password
    NC_PHOTO_PATH=/Photos/
    ```

2.  Build and run with Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3.  Access the app at `http://localhost`.

## Features

- **Weighted Random Selection**: Recent photos (last 3 months) and Favorites get higher priority.
- **EXIF Data**: Displays date taken and GPS status.
- **Image Proxy**: Serves images securely from Nextcloud through the app.
